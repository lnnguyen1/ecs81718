            One thing I have been facinated with lately.  Creating playlists.  I don't have all the fancy stuff like Spotify
            but once I realized you could create playlists on Youtube, I was hooked.  My music facination lately has been classic
            rock and that whole 90s vibe.  Of course, I just had to create a playlist for my developing story.  I loved the whole
            feel of the tv show Stranger Things (it's kinda popular, maybe you know it?) and the feel of Halsey's Room 93 album and 
            the music videos that went along with it.  If you don't get my referances, I'm talking about that washed out color, small town,
            faded ripped jeans kind of vibe.  Music is always my favorite way to create a setting for a story.

              An issue I stubbled upon was
            character names.  And I can't really help you with that because I myself suck at coming up with names myself.  My only advice
            for you is, sit down, search up baby names and sit there with a bowl of icecream until you find the perfect name.

            I had recently bought myself my own writing journal.  I just loved the idea of having my stories around with me all
            the time, and just having that feel of what it was like to write back then before the internet.  At the time, I did't write any stories  
             for almost a whole year.  I was desperate.  I came up with an idea of writing a series of fantasy short stories, but that idea lasted
            for like, what, three days, and back to drafting I went.  Then I had a day that probably wasn't one of my best.  And I just sat there on my bed at 11:00pm
            just thinking about all the bad things I've gone through.  Then suddenly I had an idea.  I grabed my journaland wrote it all down.
            I had created three characters, based on three people in my life that facinated me the most (in both very bad and very good ways).
            I created a main character who crosses paths with these three characters, each showing him/her a different part of life.
            And for two hours, I just wrote.  I soon realized though, looking back at what I wrote that night, I was writing somewhat like a story of 
            my life.  That was when I knew that this was a story I wanted to tell, that I had to tell.  So the lesson is, stories come
            always when you least expect them to.
