            <h4>
            When starting a story, you'll obviously need inspiration!
            You can get this inspiration by simply surfing through the web, at least,
            that's how I find mine.  This spark can come from artwork,
            photographs or fanfiction, just to name a few.  But personally, 
            I think traveling is the best way to find ideas.  If you go somewhere exotic
            or just walk around your town, there is no doubt that you'd find a story.
            Truth is, there are stories everywhere you go, you just to look
            at the world around you a little closer and you'll find them.

            What Genre?
          </h1>
          <p>
            <h4>
              This is a question writers ask all the time.  But the first
              question you should ask yourself is "Am I writing a story worth
              reading, or worth writing?".  This really depends on the writer,
              but always write a story you can relate to.  If you love creating worlds,
              try writing fantasy or sci-fi.  If you want to discuss issues in society
              today, or write somewhat like a story of your life, try contemporary also
              known as realistic fiction.  In my opinion, for a beginner writer, 
              it's best to start off with realistic fiction because it's somewhat
              easier than writing fantasy.  You wouldn't have to worry about
              world building as much, becasue the world you are using is already created
              for you.  This way, you are able to focus more on developing round, 
              3D characters.  In the end, it's up to you and the kind of story you want 
              to tell.

                <li>A classic story but with a spin.  Maybe change the gender roles.</li>

              These are just some prompts you can use to warm up, 
              or to brainstorm ideas, but again, your story is entirely up
              to you.  You can do something crazy that no ones heard of before
              (publishers love that) or a spin on a classic.  Really, anything that feels
              right to you, and that you would <i>enjoy</i> writing about.
